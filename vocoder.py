# 1. Write a method called shout that takes in a string as an argument and returns it in all caps.




# 2. Write a method called whisper that takes in a string as an argument and returns it in all lowercase.





# 3. Write a method called how_many_letters that takes in a string as an argument and returns the number of letters in that string.





# 4. Write a method called work_it that takes in a string as an argument and returns it backwards and with the first letter capitalized.
#    For example, work_it("I put my thing down flip it and reverse it") would return "Ti esrever dna ti pilf nwod gniht ym tup i"





# 5. Write a method called repeat_it that takes in a word and a number, and returns the word that many times.
#    For example, repeat_it("Banana", 3) would return "BananaBananaBanana"





# 6. Write a method called will_it_nametag that takes in a name and a number, and tells you whether the name can be printed on a nametag that size.
#    For example, will_it_nametag("Peter", 10) will return True, but will_it_nametag("Peter", 4) will return False, because "Peter" is 5 letters long, and needs at least 5 spaces to fit on a nametag.





# 7. Write a method called add_liar that takes in two numbers and prints out a lie like "Sorry, I don't know how to add ___ and ___."
#    BUT even though it *prints* that it doesn't know the answer, have the method return the correct answer anyways.





# 8. CHALLENGE: Now that you've written all these methods, try combining them. what would happen if you tried to call repeat_it(work_it("Stressed"), 3) ?





# 9. MEGA CHALLENGE: Write a method called doubler that takes in a string and returns it with every letter doubled.
#    For example, doubler("Lost in the Woods") would return "LLoosstt iinn tthhee WWooooddss"
